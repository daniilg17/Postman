# 🧪 Testing RESTful Booker API

This repository contains the results of **manual API testing** for the [**Restful Booker**](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html#api-Booking-GetBookings) service — an open REST API designed for performing booking-related operations.

The goal was to verify the functionality and reliability of key HTTP endpoints, detect validation issues and logical errors, and assess how the API handles incorrect or edge-case input.

## ✅ What Was Done

* Thoroughly studied the API documentation
* Created positive and negative test cases for main endpoints
* Performed manual testing using Postman
* Identified several issues related to validation and response consistency
* Prepared a Postman collection for reuse and automation
* Documented all bugs in a structured bug report

## 🛠 Tools Used

* **Postman** — for creating and sending HTTP requests
* **Google Sheets** — for managing test cases and documenting bugs
* **Git & GitHub** — for version control and storing deliverables
